   - implement separate interrupt to cope with UI (encoders, buttons, calculation of filter coefficients) in order to free audio interrupt
   - SSB autotune algorithm taken from Robert Dick
   - RTTY and CW decoder
   - BPSK decoder
   - UKW DX filters for WFM prior to FM demodulation (110kHz, 80kHz, 57kHz)
   - test dBm measurement according to filter passband
   - RDS decoding in wide FM reception mode ;-): very hard, but could be barely possible
   - finetune AGC parameters and make AGC HANG TIME, AGC HANG THRESHOLD and AGC HANG DECAY user-adjustable
   - record and playback IQ audio stream ;-)
   - read stations´ frequencies from SD card and display station names when tuned to a frequency
   - implement Motorola C-QUAM AM Stereo demodulation
   - CW peak filter (independently adjustable from notch filter)
