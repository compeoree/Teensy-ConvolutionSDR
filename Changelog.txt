HISTORY OF IMPLEMENTED FEATURES
   - 12kHz to 30MHz Receive PLUS 76 - 108MHz: undersampling-by-3 with slightly reduced sensitivity
   - I & Q - correction in software (manual correction or automatic correction)
   - efficient frequency translation without multiplication
   - efficient spectrum display using a 256 point FFT on the first 256 samples of every 4096 sample-cycle
   - efficient AM demodulation with ARM functions
   - efficient DC elimination after AM demodulation
   - implemented nine different AM demodulation algorithms for comparison (only two could stand the test and one algorithm was finally left in the implementation)
   - real SAM - synchronous AM demodulation with phase determination by atan2f implemented from the wdsp lib
   - Stereo-SAM and sideband-selected SAM
   - sample rate from 48k to 192k and decimation-by-8 for efficient realtime calculations
   - spectrum Zoom function 1x, 2x, 4x, 512x, 1024x, 2048x, 4096x --> 4096x zoom with sub-Hz resolution
   - Automatic gain control (high end algorithm by Warren Pratt, wdsp)
   - plays MP3 and M4A (iTunes files) from SD card with the awesome lib by Frank Bösing (his old MP3 lib, not the new one)
   - automatic IQ amplitude and phase imbalance correction
   - dynamic frequency indicator figures and graticules on spectrum display x-axis
   - kind of menu system now working with many variables that can be set by the encoders
   - EEPROM save & load of important settings
   - wideband FM demodulation with deemphasis
   - automatic codec gain adjustment depending on the sample input level
   - spectrum display AGC to allow display of very small signals
   - spectrum display in WFM activated (alpha version . . .)
   - optimized automatic test whether mirror rejection is working - if not, codec is restarted automatically until we have working mirror rejection
   - display mirror rejection check ("IQtest" in red box)
   - activated integrated codec 5-band graphic equalizer
   - added digital attenuator PE4306 bit-banging SPI control [0 -31dB attenuation possible]
   - added backlight control for TFT in the menu --> problem with audio distortion and sometimes display becomes white . . .
   - added analog gain display (analog codec gain AND attenuation displayed)
   - fixed major bug associated with too small "string" variables for printing, leading to annoying audio clicks
   - STEREO FM reception implemented, simultaneously switched WFM reception from 5x undersampling to 3x undersampling --> much more sensitivity (about 6dB plus!)
     and disabled spectrum display in WFM STEREO mode, because the digital noise of the refresh of the spectrum display does seriously distort audio
   - manual notch filter implemented [in the frequency domain: simply deletes bins before the iFFT]
   - bandwidth adjustment of manual notch filter implemented
   - graphical display of manual notch filters in the frequency domain
   - Michaels excellent noise blanker is working! Eliminates noise impulses very nicely and effectively!
   - leaky LMS algorithm from the wdsp lib implemented (but not working as expected . . .)
   - switched to complex filter coefficients for general filter in the fast convolution process
   - freely adjustable bandpasses & passband tuning in AM/SAM/SSB . . .
   - rebuilt convolution with more flexible choice of FFT size --> now default FFT size is 512, because of memory constraints when using 1024 . . .
   - decimation and interpolation filters are calculated with new algorithm and are calculated on-the-fly when changing filter characteristics --> much less hiss and ringing of the filters
   - Blackman-Harris four-term window for main FIR filter (as in PowerSDR)
   - first test of a 110kHz lowpass filter in the WFM path for FM (stereo) reception on VHF --> does work properly but causes strange effects (button swaps) because of memory constraints when assigning the FIR instances
   - changed default to 512tap FFT in order to have enough memory for MP3 playing and other things
   - updated Arduino to version 1.8.5 and Teensyduino to version 1.40 and had to change some of the code
   - repaired FM reception and FM stereo
   - implemented spectral noise reduction in the frequency domain by implementing another FFT-iFFT-overlap-add chain on the real audio output after the main filter
   - spectral weighting algorithm Kim et al. 2002 implemented[working!]
   - spectral weighting algorithm Romanin et al. 2009 / Schmitt et al. 2002 implemented (minimum statistics)[obsolete]
   - spectral weighting algorithm Romanin et al. 2009 implemented (voice activity detector)[working, without VAD now]
   - fixed bug in alias filter switching when changing bandpass filter coefficients
   - adjustment in finer filter frequency steps when below 500Hz (switch to 50Hz steps instead of 100Hz)
   - fixed several bugs in band switching and mode switching
   - final tweak of spectral NR algorithms finished (many parameters eliminated from menu)
   - for comparison added LMS and leaky LMS to NR menu choice (four NR algorithms to choose from: Kim, Romanin, leaky LMS, LMS)
   - changed spectral NR Romanin to newest version by Michael DL2FW [the final UHSDR version, 22.2.2018]
   - analog clock design
   - spectrum display FFT windowing bug fixed (thanks, Bob Larkin!)
   - ZoomFFT repaired and now fully functional for all magnifications (up to 2048x), additional IIR filters added, also added higher refresh rate!
